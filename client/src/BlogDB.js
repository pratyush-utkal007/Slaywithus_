      "Style is nothing but one's curiosity to match the similar and the opposites”, This is something Jigyansa believes. Cotton and Velvet combination? sounds weird but a look at this pic and you will be forced to believe in this uncanny choice. The maroon velvet full length top is paired with this cotton stripped skirt. While the skirt is light in color and adds that elegance, the velvet top brings in that vibrance to the attire. The brown boots does play its part in accentuating the legs and blends perfectly, boosting the overall look. This pair of cotton and velvet brings in that uniqueness to the table. While cotton fabric is supposed to be the most comfortable one and for that reason a favorite with the masses, velvet is supposed to be smooth and is typically made from silk which elevates its value as well. When worn together they promise fashion, comfort and style at their best",
